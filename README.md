[![build status](https://github.com/coryrylan/angular-github-actions/workflows/Build/badge.svg)](https://github.com/GDGCochabamba/wgj-website/actions)

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 10.0.3.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/wgj-website` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

### Building as a pre-rendered site

Run `scully` to build the project as a pre-rendered site, the static build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/static` directory. Scully requires that the project was already built and that distribution files were generated, so `ng build` has to run before.

Running `npm run build:prod` automatically runs _ng build_ and _scully_ in production mode.

_Note: The current Firebase configuration expects that the build artifacts are stored in the `dist/static` directory._

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
